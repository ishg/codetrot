            <p>
            We took a train from Florence to Naples and bought tickets for the local 
                Circumvesuviana train that was supposed to take us to Sorrento. All 
                websites and tour books we had read had advised us to watch out for
                 pickpockets in this area and especially on the Circumvesuviana. 
                Therefore, I was on full vigilance mode when I noticed a couple of local 
                ruffians harassing a bunch of girls. I, being the upstanding citizen that
                 I am, automatically jumped to the rescue when the goons got distracted
                 by my dashing turban. 
               </p>
            <div class="left"><ul class="increaseleft"><li><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HMb0Odvr5_8/UeFbzxReVWI/AAAAAAAAGGE/Wda-2VWQslY/w350-h200-no/IMG_4070.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-HMb0Odvr5_8/UeFbzxReVWI/AAAAAAAAGGE/Wda-2VWQslY/w750-h500-no/IMG_4070.JPG" /><br />The "beaches" of S. Agnello.</span></li></ul></div>
                <p> 
                Since I had anticipated their move, I maintained
                 a poker face with my pocketknife in my hand and Jack Reacher fighting 
                techniques in my head and stared them down. They got off on the next 
                stop and the ride was uneventful after that. We arrived in S. Agnello
                 (a suburb of Sorrento so to say) and it immediately reminded me of 
                India, but cleaner and full of nice white people. The small town feel 
                was in the air and there were scooters everywhere you looked. The local 
                vibe in the streets peppered with grocery shops and small convenience 
                stores felt very welcoming. 
               </p>
            <div class="right"><ul class="increaseright"><li><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7RHqSqEEPsI/UeFb2ndX0PI/AAAAAAAAGG0/ahsUIOrnQqg/w350-h200-no/IMG_4121.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7RHqSqEEPsI/UeFb2ndX0PI/AAAAAAAAGG0/ahsUIOrnQqg/w750-h500-no/IMG_4121.JPG" /><br />Bajaj Chetak! Not really, it's a Vespa.</span></li></ul></div>
                <p> 
                In contrast to Cinque Terre, I glimpsed a 
                lot of native people in Sorrento, children playing in the streets, 
                couples sitting on benches, and elders playing cards outside a cafe.
                 We walked to our hostel which was outfitted like a modern three star
                 hotel and was apparently famous enough to have been graced by the 
                presence of celebrities but not so much that I would remember their names. 
                After getting settled in, we walked down to Sorrento to eat dinner
                 and check out the city. On the way there and back, we managed to 
                take some excellent pictures of the Bay of Naples with Mount Vesuvius
                 faint in the background. 
                </p>

                <p>
                Our hostel’s terrace was even better than 
                the one in Florence. This one had three different tiers along with a 
                bar and a view of two soccer fields. Needless to say, I spent the 
                rest of the night with Jack Reacher and some quality Italian football. 
                The hostel provided breakfast the next morning and we walked down to
                 Sorrento to catch a bus to the towns of Amalfi and Positano on the
                 Amalfi Coast. 
                </p>
            <div class="right"><ul class="increaseright"><li><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WXY9cjWf1u8/UeFb3HA1NlI/AAAAAAAAGHA/SBgwQd-0yzI/w350-h200-no/IMG_4124.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WXY9cjWf1u8/UeFb3HA1NlI/AAAAAAAAGHA/SBgwQd-0yzI/w750-h500-no/IMG_4124.JPG" /><br />The Amalfi Road.</span></li></ul></div>
                <p>
                The guidebooks had recommended to find a window seat 
                on the right side of the bus and I was lucky enough to get one, because 
                the view was SPECTACULAR. The winding road took us along the coast with
                 the cliffs dropping straight down into the pure blue waters. Our 
                driver must have been the distant cousin of the one driving Rowling’s 
                Knight Bus, because he couldn’t possibly have maneuvered through the 
                tight twisting turns without some magical help. We got off in Positano 
                which is a  very pretty town with a beautiful beach. 
                </p>
            <div class="left"><ul class="increaseleft"><li><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-afdDUIyv7CU/UeFb4Yf6XdI/AAAAAAAAGHU/AFW04ZGZWOQ/w350-h200-no/IMG_4142.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-afdDUIyv7CU/UeFb4Yf6XdI/AAAAAAAAGHU/AFW04ZGZWOQ/w750-h500-no/IMG_4142.JPG" /><br />The Positano bay littered with luxury yachts.</span></li></ul></div>
                <p>
                We decided to 
                return to it later and proceeded to fight for our spot on the next
                 bus headed for Amalfi. We had to stand because the bus was packed,
                 and the road to Amalfi ended up being even worse in terms of twists
                 and turns. Unfortunately, a lady sitting a little ahead of me was 
                unable to hold in her lunch. The Scottish gentleman who had been 
                standing next to the lady moved down by me and proceeded to entertain 
                me for the rest of the ride by spewing colorful profanities which 
                kept me laughing uncontrollably. 
                </p>
            <div class="right"><ul class="increaseright"><li><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_PHUl1Y_9Ho/UeFb7WRewRI/AAAAAAAAGIQ/G_qTLiFQroI/w350-h200-no/IMG_4364.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_PHUl1Y_9Ho/UeFb7WRewRI/AAAAAAAAGIQ/G_qTLiFQroI/w750-h500-no/IMG_4364.JPG" /><br />A VERY delicious pastry found in S. Agnello.</span></li></ul></div>
                <p>
                Amalfi was not much different from 
                Sorrento or Positano, so we just had a quick snack and took a ferry
                 back to Positano, where we proceeded to swim and relax on the beach
                 until the sun set behind the cliffs. The ride back was not nearly as 
                entertaining, and fatigued from the day, we retired pretty early. 
                </p>

                <p>
                
                The next day took us on a day trip to Pompeii, the city that slept 
                for 1500 years. The whole place had been maintained pretty well and
                 we walked through the town among the ruins of the volcanic explosion,
                 keeping a wary eye on Vesuvius all the time. Since my interest in 
                ancient ruins had been dampened by Rome, I did not think Pompeii was
                 that interesting, but it was still cool to visit and walk in streets 
                that had been occupied a thousand years ago. The excursion took up 
                most of the day and we came back to pack up our stuff for...
