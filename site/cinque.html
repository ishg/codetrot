        <p>
        A Frecciarossa express train carried us from Rome to Pisa where we spent about two hours
             taking in the small town and the leaning tower. However, the mid-day heat caught up 
            to us and we went back to the train station to catch a regional train to La Spezia 
            and onwards to Cinque Terre. On the way, we glimpsed the famous marble quarries that
             provided the marble for Michelangelo's David.

            <p>
            Cinque Terre is a collection of five 
            coastal villages that are simply made up of terraces on cliffs that run straight into
             the Ligurian Sea. The villages are connected by train as well as breathtaking coastal
             hiking paths. The first two villages of Riomaggiore and Manarola are small port towns 
            where one can rent a boat or go cliff diving. 
        </p>
            <div class="left"><ul class="increaseleft"><li><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FldHWj9XPbQ/UeFbmm2ujUI/AAAAAAAAGDI/xES_r-BnY7M/w350-h200-no/IMG_3361.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FldHWj9XPbQ/UeFbmm2ujUI/AAAAAAAAGDI/xES_r-BnY7M/w750-h500-no/IMG_3361.JPG" /><br />View from our Hostel in Corniglia</span></li></ul></div>
            <p>    
            The third and highest village of Corniglia
             is small and contains a couple hostels, some cafes, and a grocery store. We stayed in a
             hostel here and while it was quiet and peaceful at night, the roosters started up at 4 
            am and continued crowing until 7 or 8, which got quite unbearable by the second morning.
             While this small town is nice and serene, I would not recommend spending any more time 
            here than a quick stop for a snack on your coastal hike. 
            </p>
            <div class="right"><ul class="increaseright"><li><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-A5Yl1s2KPYk/UeFbrePcTMI/AAAAAAAAGEA/eLJAzbjs-tY/w350-h200-no/IMG_3407.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-A5Yl1s2KPYk/UeFbrePcTMI/AAAAAAAAGEA/eLJAzbjs-tY/w750-h500-no/IMG_3407.JPG" /><br />The Port of Vernazza.</span></li></ul></div>
            <p>
            The big port town of Vernazza is
             next up the coast and is full of tourists looking to take a dip in its beautiful harbor.
              The main square contains a bunch of fancy restaurants selling bottled water for exorbitant
             prices and the streets branching off are littered with stalls displaying various kinds of 
            fresh fruit, vegetables, and seafood. 
            </p>
            <div class="left"><ul class="increaseleft"><li><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-i0qxrEq234U/UeFbtgGa_aI/AAAAAAAAGYw/N_VWhq9SmYk/w350-h200-no/IMG_3421.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-i0qxrEq234U/UeFbtgGa_aI/AAAAAAAAGYw/N_VWhq9SmYk/w750-h500-no/IMG_3421.JPG" /><br />Swimming in the Mediterranean.</span></li></ul></div>
            <p>
            The harbor lacked a beach, so when I went for my first
             swim in the Mediterranean here, my feet got all scratched up by the various kinds of sea 
            life clinging to the rocky surface of the cliffs. Other than not being able to walk properly
             for a day, the swim was actually pretty great! 
            </p>
            <div class="right"><ul class="increaseright"><li><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mPW2EriYyp0/UeFbvfwkmWI/AAAAAAAAGY4/o1-Xze9EbtI/w350-h200-no/DSC01697.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mPW2EriYyp0/UeFbvfwkmWI/AAAAAAAAGY4/o1-Xze9EbtI/w750-h500-no/DSC01697.JPG" /><br />The coastal hike from Corniglia to Vernazza.</span></li></ul></div>
            <p>
            The coastal hikes from Riomaggiore to 
            Corniglia were closed due to landslides, so the next morning I hiked from Corniglia to 
            Vernazza. The hike itself was relatively easy, smooth, and paved. It's the view that is 
            worth mentioning: absolutely magnificent! The lush green cliffs running into the endless 
            pure blue water were a true sight to behold. The hike did not take long so I went up to 
            an ancient castle tower in Vernazza which provided more gorgeous panoramic views of the 
            coast and the town. 
            </p>
            <div class="left"><ul class="increaseleft"><li><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YYD4WTeLV-k/UeFbug33HSI/AAAAAAAAGEs/HVM2XpFHXts/w350-h200-no/IMG_3437.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YYD4WTeLV-k/UeFbug33HSI/AAAAAAAAGEs/HVM2XpFHXts/w750-h500-no/IMG_3437.JPG" /><br />Don't miss the awesome views!</span></li></ul></div>
            <p>
            After lunch, we took another train to Monterosso, the northernmost of 
            the five towns which had a full fledged beach along with old World War Two bunkers
             refurbished as modern restaurants. The rest of the day was spent reading, napping, 
            and just chilling on the beach. Unless you plan to trawl every nook and cranny of each 
            village, I would recommend just two to three days to enjoy the Cinque Terre, but you MUST
             hike at least one coastal path if you don't want to miss out on the beautiful views.
             We said goodbye to this amazing place the next day and headed toward...
