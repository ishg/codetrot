            <p>
            The train from Cinque Terre to Venice traveled rather slowly and 
            resulted in a missed connection in Milan, but the Trenitalia 
            officials were really nice and offered us a berth on the next 
            train out. We were traveling without a reservation now, but when 
            the people whose seats we were in got on, they simply told us to
             stay put and assured us that they will find other seats. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Despite
             what all the guidebooks suggested, the people in Italy are 
            extremely polite and nice. Thankful for this fact, we spent the
             rest of the ride in peace until we smelled Venice. Yes, you can 
            smell the city from miles away, and I was worried that I was going 
            to have to spend three days torturing my olfactory system. But, as
             we entered the city itself, the smell mysteriously vanished hinting
             that Venice's solution is simply to pump the garbage out of the city.
             </p>

            <p>
            My nose was glad, because the city itself was splendid. After 
            dropping off our stuff in our hostel, we went for a walk around 
            the island and were welcomed by a group of people dancing and 
            chanting “Hare Rama, Hare Krishna!” For dinner, the most delicious 
            steak I have ever had was accompanied by a 6 euro bottle of water. 
            Dessert arrived in a cone of mango and nutella gelato. 
            Mmmm...delightful. The gelato was a welcome respite in the 
            stifling hot weather which was made worse at night because our room 
            was four floors up and had no air conditioning.
            </p>

            <p>
             We woke up in the
             morning with giant mosquito bites and ready to fight another hot day 
            in Venice. Starting with a ferry ride along the Grand Canal to the 
            island of Murano, we visited the famous glass blowing factories and 
            witnessed a master mold impressive masterpieces out of melted glass 
            in the blink of an eye. This was truly an island , as the merchandise 
            itself was ridiculously expensive. The ferry brought us back to Venice 
            where we walked around a bit more and had a great sandwich from a small
             panini shop for lunch. 
            </p>
            <div class="right"><ul class="increaseright"><li><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NUgQfHcxFC0/UeFbhkfmEJI/AAAAAAAAGCA/SRLxj6btoJY/w350-h200-no/IMG_3749.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NUgQfHcxFC0/UeFbhkfmEJI/AAAAAAAAGCA/SRLxj6btoJY/w750-h500-no/IMG_3749.JPG" /><br />Piazza San Marco</span></li></ul></div>
            <p>
            In the evening, we trekked over to Piazza San Marco,
             the biggest plaza in Venice which was consequently full of tourists. 
            Venice is truly an interesting place, combining traditional architecture
             with modern stores such as Giorgio Armani and Gucci sitting alongside 
            huge behemoth churches. The squares here were a bit smaller than in Rome, 
            but they packed the same punch when they appeared out of a labyrinth of 
            narrow winding streets.
            </p>
            <div class="left"><ul class="increaseleft"><li><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vNsf0yiQ3Ew/UeFbdoU0k6I/AAAAAAAAGBM/GcDaOwISkP0/w350-h200-no/IMG_3585.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vNsf0yiQ3Ew/UeFbdoU0k6I/AAAAAAAAGBM/GcDaOwISkP0/w750-h500-no/IMG_3585.JPG" /><br />The waterways were pretty picturesque.</span></li></ul></div>
            <p>
             Before visiting, I had the impression that you could
             hardly walk anywhere in Venice and had to take the ferry or gondola 
            (which costs 160 euros per hour by the way!) everywhere. But it turns out 
            that Venice is a great walking city as long as you are willing to take on 
            roads that have more twists and turns than my headphone cables. When guidebooks
             mention that it is very easy to get lost in the streets of Venice, they are not
             exaggerating.  
            </p>
            <div class="right"><ul class="increaseright"><li><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SwFOX2OwxZg/UeFbfmp4LNI/AAAAAAAAGBk/AXUDzhw8EYw/w350-h200-no/IMG_3651.JPG" /><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-SwFOX2OwxZg/UeFbfmp4LNI/AAAAAAAAGBk/AXUDzhw8EYw/w750-h500-no/IMG_3651.JPG" /><br />I'm running out of captions.</span></li></ul></div>
            <p>
            However, as long as you keep a cool head and follow the throng 
            of people heading in one direction or other, you can usually get to where you 
            want without ending up in Narnia. It's also in Venice that I first noticed Italian music, it was very 
            upbeat and chill at the same time. The city itself also has a very relaxing 
            atmosphere and is great for people watching while drinking a cappuccino or 
            eating some delicious gelato. While we were sorry to leave this lovely island, 
            we bid good riddance to the heat and...
